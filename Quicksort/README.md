# Quicksort

a program that takes input from a document and creates an arraylist. The arraylists are then duplicated and sorted using four different types of quick sorts (first element pivot, random element pivot, median of three random elements pivot, and median of three chosen elements pivot). The program then outputs the duration of each type of sort as well as the time it takes to perform an insertion sort.
